          <p>
            This site is a home for dynamic, interactive MathArt. It is built on
            a personal fascination on nestations with randomness, and as I'd
            like to call it — <i>structured chaos</i>.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            The idea began with a simple question:{" "}
            <i>Can something feel both structured and unpredictable?</i> That
            led to the concept of nestations, layering harmonic motions within
            each other. Each layer is simple and patterned on its own, but when
            nested and driven by random or chosen parameters, the result becomes
            surprisingly intricate, unique, and expressive. While the math
            behind these pieces isn’t driven by advanced theory, the process
            itself — recursive, intuitive, and emergent — mirrors deeper
            mathematical ideas like fractals and chaos. These are not
            simulations of theorems, but explorations of form and behavior using
            math as a creative tool.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            This site exists to bring those ideas to life. It’s a space for
            visual experimentation, where small changes ripple outward into
            entirely new art pieces. Visitors can explore curated galleries or
            generate their own versions through interactive tools. The goal
            isn’t just to present finished pieces, but to invite play,
            customization, and creative discovery. At its core, this project is
            about sharing a sense of visual curiosity, and perhaps helping
            others explore abstract mathematical art that I wish I had more
            exposure to growing up.
